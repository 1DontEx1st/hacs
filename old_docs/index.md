## Last notes from the initial developer

First startup after installation will take some time, but it's worth it.

This was developed under the influence of üç∫, a lot of üç∫, [if you want to support my work feel free to buy me a ‚òïÔ∏è (most likely üç∫)](https://buymeacoffee.com/ludeeus)

How it works and what it does are added based on a single persons mindset, you may not agree with what I have done, if you have a suggestion please open an [RFC](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs/issues).
